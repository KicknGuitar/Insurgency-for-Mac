This collection was created in hopes to make a MacBook Pro (Late-2010), running Mac OS 10.7/10.9 play Insurgency smoothly. It was compiled by an ignorant fraud named KicknGuitar.


===INSTRUCTIONS===

==Installing==
==Cfg File====

1. Locate Insurgency's "cfg" folder, nestled in the Steam/Insurgency folders. If you installed steam for all users the path should be:

	/Applications/steamapps/common/insurgency2/insurgency/

2. Download & move "autoexec.cfg" into the cfg folder.

Notes.
	There are commands on the file that I am uncertain if they are needed (such as the sound commands from Praetor192). Others I have simply removed. Compare it with the sources' cfgs for differences.
	"//" tells the computer to disregard that line. I have used them to "turn off" commands that are listed as one of the tiered cheats or server-side commands. It's dead space and can be removed unless you want them for when you're on a server that let's you use them. 


==Installing=======
==Priority Script==

1. Download "Insurgency-Priority.app" and move it into your /Applications/ folder.
2. Open "Script Editor" (Cmd + Spacebar to find this app via spotlight).
3. Open "Insurgency-Priority.app"
4. Enter path to Insurgency app between quotes. If the app is not installed for everyone, it may be in the Applications folder for a user. You'd enter it like so:

	"BobDole HD:Users:BobDole:Applications:Insurgency.app"

5. Enter your admin password between quotes and save.

Notes.
	The script/app requires insurgency to be running yet it takes too long for Insurgency to load so I have a popup box that waits for the user to press "run". Once Insurgency has gotten to the main screen, I cmd+TAB out to the waiting box and press run.
	Fin.
